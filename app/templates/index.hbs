			<h2>Yeoman is not a library, but a workflow of best practices</h2>
			<p>
				Yeoman 1.0 is more than just a tool. It's a workflow; a collection of tools and best practices working in harmony to make developing for the web even better.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our workflow is comprised of three tools for improving your productivity and satisfaction when building a web app: yo (the scaffolding tool), grunt (the build tool) and bower (for package management).
			</p>
			<p>
				Yo scaffolds out a new application, writing your Grunt configuration and pulling in relevant Grunt tasks that you might need for your build.
			</p>
			<h3>Pre-Requisites</h3>
			<ul class="launch-pad-std">
				<li class="html5-list-item">You have to have <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NPM</a> installed for Node.js package managment</li>
				<li class="html5-list-item">You will also need to have <a href="http://www.gruntjs.com">Grunt</a> installed as your task runner</li>
			</ul>	
			<h3>Quick Install</h3>				
			<pre>
				<span class="classic-git">npm install -g grunt-contrib-compass</span>
			</pre>
			<ul class="launch-pad-std">
				<li class="html5-list-item">Then install Yeoman via npm</li>			
			</ul>

		</ul>
		<p>
			Leaflet is a modern open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. It is developed by Vladimir Agafonkin with a team of dedicated contributors. Weighing just about 33 KB of JS, it has all the features most developers ever need for
			online maps.
		</p>
		<p>
			Leaflet is designed with simplicity, performance and usability in mind. It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms out of the box, taking advantage of HTML5 and CSS3 on modern browsers while still being accessible on older ones.
			It can be extended with a huge amount of plugins, has a beautiful, easy to use and well-documented API and a simple, readable source code that is a joy to contribute to.
